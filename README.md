# Sales-Analysis-of-Amazon
In this project, I used Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that analyzes Amazon's multi-year sales performance. The dataset includes detailed sales metrics across different regions, customer segments, and product categories.

## Key Metrics & Features
The dashboard showcases the following key metrics and insights:
- Sales Projection: Total projected sales (e.g., 12.64M)
- Product Units Sold: Total units (e.g., 178K)
- KPI Score: Performance indicator (e.g., 3.48)
- Returns: Number of returned items

## Visual Analysis
The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations to support data-driven decisions:
- Sales by Segment: Breakdown across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office
- Sales by Market: Insights by Asia Pacific, Europe, USCA, LATAM, and Africa
- Sales by Region: Interactive world map with geospatial insights
- Profit by Customer Name: Identifies top customers by profit contribution
- Loss by Product Name: Highlights products with the highest loss
- Profit by Product Name: Displays most profitable products

## Tools Used
- Power BI for data modeling, visualization, and interactivity
- DAX for custom KPIs and calculated fields
- Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query Editor

## Objective
- The goal of this dashboard is to help stakeholders:
- Identify profitable products and customer segments

- Optimize marketing and sales strategies
- Minimize losses and improve operational efficiency
